🧩 Console App for Testing OOP Concepts – C#

A simple yet powerful C# Console Application designed to demonstrate and test key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
This project serves as a practical example and learning tool for understanding OOP principles in action.

---------------------------

🚀 Overview

This console app provides hands-on demonstrations of how OOP principles can be applied to build structured, reusable, and maintainable code.
Each concept is implemented through dedicated classes and examples that simulate real-world scenarios — such as managing employees, vehicles, or accounts.

🧠 Key OOP Concepts Covered
| Concept           | Description                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Protecting data using access modifiers, getters, and setters.        |
| **Inheritance**   | Reusing base class properties and behaviors in derived classes.      |
| **Polymorphism**  | Achieving dynamic behavior through method overriding and interfaces. |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features.  |

-------------------------------

---------------------------------

🎯 Learning Objectives

Understand how OOP principles improve software design.

Learn how to create and use classes, interfaces, and inheritance hierarchies.

Observe runtime polymorphism in action using method overriding.

Practice encapsulation through private data and controlled access methods.

🔮 Future Enhancements

✅ Add examples of abstract classes and sealed classes

✅ Implement composition and aggregation

✅ Add unit tests for OOP behaviors

✅ Include real-world case studies (e.g., banking, HR, or e-commerce systems)
